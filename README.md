>“Even if there is endless documentation, it would be impossible to know what a man thought inside his own mind... This is where the novelist's creative imagination has to take over”

>― Irving Stone

### Project:

A technical documentation demo for Free Code Camp's Responsive Design Certificate curriculum

### The Problem:

Create a one-page "Technical Documentation" for a chosen technology in the style of [this site]( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL).
  
* Must complete a series of [user stories](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page)

* Must be aesthetically pleasing and use HTML and CSS

### Why React?

![React Wordmark](https://res.cloudinary.com/mpauldesigns/image/upload/v1535207152/React_logo_wordmark.png)

React is a simple and lightweight framework with a component-based structure I enjoy. I like to mix and match pieces and build with small testable units.

### Technologies Used:

HTML and CSS flexbox

### Future upgrades:

There's a slight bug with where the hotlinks go on the page where things are sometimes covered by the sticky menu on mobile screens. I would definitely like to figure that one out.
