>“Even if there is endless documentation, it would be impossible to know what a man thought inside his own mind... This is where the novelist's creative imagination has to take over”

>― Irving Stone

### Project:

A technical documentation demo for Free Code Camp's Responsive Design curriculum

### The Problem:

Create a one-page "Tribute Page" for a chosen hero in the style of [this site]( https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx).
  
* Must complete a series of [user stories](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page)

* Must be aesthetically pleasing and use only html and css

### Why React?

Richard Feynman was an incredible polymath and insatiably curious. As a teacher, I have studied his techniques and lessons and appreciate that one doesn't really understand a subject until one can break it down and explain it in simple words. In his unusual methods, troublemaking antics, and offbeat sense of humor I find a kindred spirit.

### Technologies Used:

Simple html with an open-source digital newspaper stylesheet and Bootstrap.

### Future upgrades:

Now that I've had more experience with responsive design and flexbox, I'd like to make this cleaner on different screen-sizes and optimized for mobile. I would add more whitespace and tweak the scales between elements. I would also love to add a Feynman video, booklist, online course reference, or sound clip.
