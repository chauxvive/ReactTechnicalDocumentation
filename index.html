            <p>The smallest React example looks like this:</p>

            <p><code>ReactDOM.render(&lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;,
                    document.getElementById('root')); </code></p>

            <p>It displays a heading saying “Hello, world!” on the page.

                <h2>How to Read This Guide</h2>

                <p>In this guide, we will examine the building blocks of React apps: elements and components. Once you
                    master them, you can create complex apps from small reusable pieces.</p>

                <p>Tip:</p>

                <p>This guide is designed for people who prefer learning concepts step by step. If you prefer to learn
                    by doing, check out our practical tutorial. You might find this guide and the tutorial
                    complementary to each other.</p>

                <p>This is the first chapter in a step-by-step guide about main React concepts. You can find a list of
                    all its chapters in the navigation sidebar. If you’re reading this from a mobile device, you can
                    access the navigation by pressing the button in the bottom right corner of your screen.</p>

                <p>Every chapter in this guide builds on the knowledge introduced in earlier chapters. You can learn
                    most of React by reading the “Main Concepts” guide chapters in the order they appear in the
                    sidebar. For example, “Introducing JSX” is the next chapter after this one.</p>

                <h2>Knowledge Level Assumptions</h2>
                <p>React is a JavaScript library, and so we’ll assume you have a basic understanding of the JavaScript
                    language. If you don’t feel very confident, we recommend going through a JavaScript tutorial to
                    check your knowledge level and enable you to follow along this guide without getting lost. It might
                    take you between 30 minutes and an hour, but as a result you won’t have to feel like you’re
                    learning both React and JavaScript at the same time.</p>

                <p>Note:</p>

                <p>This guide occasionally uses some of the newer JavaScript syntax in the examples. If you haven’t
                    worked with JavaScript in the last few years, these three points should get you most of the way.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Thing_Two">
            <header>
                <h1>Introducing JSX</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Consider this variable declaration:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
            <p>This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML.</p>

            <p>It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to
                describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the
                full power of JavaScript.</p>

            <p>JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you
                can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started.</p>

            <h2>Why JSX?</h2>
            <p>React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are
                handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.</p>

            <p>Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React
                separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back
                to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk
                might convince you otherwise.</p>

            <p>React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI
                inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.</p>

            <p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>

            <h2>Embedding Expressions in JSX</h2>
            <p>In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in
                curly braces:</p>

            <pre>
<code>const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}&lt;/h1&gt;

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);</code></pre>

            <p>You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2,
                user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions.</p>

            <pre>In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an &lt;h1&gt; element.</pre>

            <pre><code>function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}

const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};

const element = (
  &lt;h1&gt;
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  &lt;/h1&gt;
);

ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
); </code></pre>

            <p>We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also
                recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion.</p>

            <h2>JSX is an Expression Too</h2>
            <p>After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript
                objects.</p>

            <p>This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it
                as arguments, and return it from functions:</p>

            <pre><code>function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {formatName(user)}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Stranger.&lt;/h1&gt;;
} </code></pre>

            <h2>Specifying Attributes with JSX</h2>
            <p>You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;div tabIndex="0"&gt;</div>;</code>

            <p>You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;img src={user.avatarUrl}&gt;&lt;/img&gt;;</code>

            <p>Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should
                either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same
                attribute.</p>

            <p>Warning:</p>

            <p>Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention
                instead of HTML attribute names.</p>

            <p>For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.</p>

            <h2>Specifying Children with JSX</h2>
            <p>If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;img src={user.avatarUrl} /&gt;; </code>
            <p>JSX tags may contain children:</p>

            <pre><code>const element = (
  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;Hello!&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;h2&ht;Good to see you here.&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
); </code></pre>

            <h2>JSX Prevents Injection Attacks</h2>
            <p>It is safe to embed user input in JSX:</p>

            <pre><code>const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = &lt;h1&gt;{title}&lt;/h1&gt;; </code></pre>

            <p>By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you
                can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to
                a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.</p>

            <h2>JSX Represents Objects</h2>
            <p>Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls.</p>

            <p>These two examples are identical:</p>

            <pre><code>const element = (
  &lt;h1 className="greeting"&gt;
    Hello, world!
  &lt;/h1&gt;
);
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
); </code></pre>

            <p>React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates
                an object like this:</p>

            <pre><code>// Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
}; </code></pre>

            <p>These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see
                on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date.</p>

            <p>We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the next section.</p>

            <p>Tip:</p>

            <p>We recommend using the “Babel” language definition for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX
                code is properly highlighted. This website uses the Oceanic Next color scheme which is compatible with
                it.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Thing_Three">
            <header>
                <h1>Rendering Elements</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps.</p>

            <p>An element describes what you want to see on the screen:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;</code>

            <p>Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes
                care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.</p>

            <p>Note:</p>

            <p>One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. We will introduce
                components in the next section. Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you to
                read this section before jumping ahead.</p>

            <h2>Rendering an Element into the DOM</h2>
            <p>Let’s say there is a &lt;div&gt; somewhere in your HTML file:</p>

            <code>&lt;div id="root"&gt;</div></code>

            <p>We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM.</p>

            <p>Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React
                into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like.</p>

            <p>To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():</p>

            <pre><code>const element = &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world&lt;/h1&gt;;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));</code></pre>

            <p>It displays “Hello, world” on the page.</p>

            <h2>Updating the Rendered Element</h2>

            <p>React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes.
                An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time.</p>

            <p>With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to
                ReactDOM.render().</p>

            <p>Consider this ticking clock example:</p>

            <pre><code>function tick() {
  const element = (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}

setInterval(tick, 1000); </code></pre>

            <p>It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.</p>

            <p>Note:</p>

            <p>In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how
                such code gets encapsulated into stateful components.</p>

            <p>We recommend that you don’t skip topics because they build on each other.<p>

                    <h2>React Only Updates What’s Necessary</h2>
                    <p>React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM
                        updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state.</p>

                    <p>You can verify by inspecting the last example with the browser tools:</p>

                    <p>DOM inspector showing granular updates<p>

                            <p>Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the
                                text node whose contents has changed gets updated by React DOM.</p>

                            <p>In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment rather than
                                how to change it over time eliminates a whole class of bugs.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Thing_Four">
            <header>
                <h1>Components and Props</h1>
            </header>
            <p>Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in
                isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. <a href="#">You can find a
                    detailed component API reference here.</a></p>

            <p>Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”)
                and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.</p>

            <h2>Functional and Class Components</h2>
            <p>The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function:</p>

            <pre><code>function Welcome(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}</code></pre>

            <p>This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for
                properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “functional”
                because they are literally JavaScript functions.</p>

            <p>You can also use an ES6 class to define a component:</p>

            <pre><code>class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {this.props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
}</code></pre>

            <p>The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view.</p>

            <p>Classes have some additional features that we will discuss in the next sections. Until then, we will use
                functional components for their conciseness.</p>

            <h2>Rendering a Component</h2>
            <p>Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;div /&gt;;</code>
            <p>However, elements can also represent user-defined components:</p>

            <code>const element = &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;; </code>

            <p>When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes to this
                component as a single object. We call this object “props”.</p>

            <p>For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page:</p>

            <pre><code>function Welcome(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

const element = &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
);</code></pre>

            <p>Let’s recap what happens in this example:</p>

            <p>We call ReactDOM.render() with the &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt; element.</p>

            <p>React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props. Our Welcome component returns a
                &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt; element as the result.
                React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match &lt;h1&gt;Hello, Sara&lt;/h1&gt;.
                Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.</p>

            <p>React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, &lt;div /&gt;
                represents an HTML div tag, but &lt;Welcome /&gt; represents a component and requires Welcome to be in
                scope.</p>

            <p>You can read more about the reasoning behind this convention here.</p>

            <h2>Composing Components</h2>
            <p>Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component
                abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are
                commonly expressed as components.</p>

            <p>For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:</p>

            <pre><code>function Welcome(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Welcome name="Sara" /&gt;
      &lt;Welcome name="Cahal" /&gt;
      &lt;Welcome name="Edite" /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;App /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);</code></pre>

            <p>Typically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React
                into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work
                your way to the top of the view hierarchy.</p>

            <h2>Extracting Components</h2>
            <p>Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components.</p>

            <p>For example, consider this Comment component:</p>

            <pre><code>function Comment(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className="Comment"&gt;
      &lt;div className="UserInfo"&gt;
        &lt;img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        /&gt;
        &lt;div className="UserInfo-name"&gt;
          {props.author.name}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="Comment-text"&gt;
        {props.text}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="Comment-date"&gt;
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
} </code></pre>

            <p>It accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a
                social media website.</p>

            <p>This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse
                individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it.</p>

            <p>First, we will extract Avatar:</p>

            <pre><code>function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    &lt;img className="Avatar"
      src={props.user.avatarUrl}
      alt={props.user.name}
    /&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

            <p>The Avatar doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given
                its prop a more generic name: user rather than author.</p>

            <p>We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is
                being used.</p>

            <p>We can now simplify Comment a tiny bit:</p>

            <pre><code>function Comment(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className="Comment"&gt;
      &lt;div className="UserInfo"&gt;
        &lt;Avatar user={props.author} /&gt;
        &lt;div className="UserInfo-name"&gt;
          {props.author.name}
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="Comment-text"&gt;
        {props.text}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="Comment-date"&gt;
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
} </code></pre>


            <p>Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user’s name:</p>

            <pre><code>function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className="UserInfo"&gt;
      &lt;Avatar user={props.user} /&gt;
      &lt;div className="UserInfo-name"&gt;
        {props.user.name}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
} </code></pre>

            <p>This lets us simplify Comment even further:</p>

            <pre><code>function Comment(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div className="Comment"&gt;
      &lt;UserInfo user={props.author} /&gt;
      &lt;div className="Comment-text"&gt;
        {props.text}
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;div className="Comment-date"&gt;
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}</code></pre>

            <p>Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components
                pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times
                (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good
                candidate to be a reusable component.</p>

            <h2>Props are Read-Only</h2>
            <p>Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider
                this sum function:</p>

            <code>function sum(a, b) {
                return a + b;
                }</code>

            <p>Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return
                the same result for the same inputs.</p>

            <p>In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input:</p>

            <pre><code>function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
}</code></pre>

            <p>React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule:</p>

            <p>All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props.</p>

            <p>Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a
                new concept of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to
                user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Thing_Five">
            <header>
                <h1>State and Lifecycle</h1>
            </header>
            <p>This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a detailed
                component API reference here.</p>

            <p>Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have
                only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output:</p>

            <pre><code>function tick() {
  const element = (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000); </code></pre>

            <p>In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will
                set up its own timer and update itself every second.</p>

            <p>We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks:</p>

            <pre><code>function Clock(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    &lt;Clock date={new Date()} /&gt;,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);</code></pre>

            <p>However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI
                every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock.</p>

            <p>Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself:</p>

            <pre><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
); </code></pre>

            <p>To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component.</p>

            <p>State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component.</p>

            <p>We mentioned before that components defined as classes have some additional features. Local state is
                exactly that: a feature available only to classes.</p>

            <p>Converting a Function to a Class
                You can convert a functional component like Clock to a class in five steps:</p>

            <p>Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component.</p>

            <p>Add a single empty method to it called render().</p>

            <p>Move the body of the function into the render() method.</p>

            <p>Replace props with this.props in the render() body.</p>

            <p>Delete the remaining empty function declaration.</p>

            <pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}</code></pre>

            <p>Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function.</p>

            <p>The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render &lt;Clock /&gt;
                into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use
                additional features such as local state and lifecycle hooks.</p>

            <h2>Adding Local State to a Class</h2>
            <p>We will move the date from props to state in three steps:</p>

            <p>Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method:</p>

            <pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}</code></pre>

            <p>Add a class constructor that assigns the initial this.state:</p>

            <pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
} </code></pre>

            <p>Note how we pass props to the base constructor:</p>

            <pre><code>constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }</code></pre>

            <p>Class components should always call the base constructor with props.</p>

            <p>Remove the date prop from the &lt;Clock /&gt; element:</p>

            <pre><code>ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);</code></pre>

            <p>We will later add the timer code back to the component itself.</p>

            <p>The result looks like this:</p>

            <pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);</code></pre>

            <p>Next, we’ll make the Clock set up its own timer and update itself every second.</p>

            <h2>Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class</h2>
            <p>In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components
                when they are destroyed.</p>

            <p>We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called
                “mounting” in React.</p>

            <p>We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called
                “unmounting” in React.</p>

            <p>We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and
                unmounts:</p>

            <pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
} </code></pre>

            <p>These methods are called “lifecycle hooks”.</p>

            <p>The componentDidMount() hook runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a
                good place to set up a timer:</p>

            <pre><code>componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () =&gt; this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  } </code></pre>

            <p>Note how we save the timer ID right on this.</p>

            <p>While this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add
                additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t participate in the
                data flow (like a timer ID).</p>

            <p>We will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle hook:</p>

            <pre><code> componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }</code></pre>

            <p>Finally, we will implement a method called tick() that the Clock component will run every second.</p>

            <p>It will use this.setState() to schedule updates to the component local state:</p>

            <pre><code>class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () =&gt; this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }

  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }

  render() {
    return (
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    );
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;Clock /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
); </code></pre>

            <p>Now the clock ticks every second.</p>

            <p>Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:</p>

            <p>When &lt;Clock /&gt; is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the constructor of the Clock component.
                Since Clock needs to display the current time, it initializes this.state with an object including the
                current time. We will later update this state.</p>

            <p>React then calls the Clock component’s render() method. This is how React learns what should be
                displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the Clock’s render output.</p>

            <p>When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() lifecycle hook. Inside
                it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s tick() method once a
                second.</p>

            <p>Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update
                by calling setState() with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the setState() call, React
                knows the state has changed, and calls the render() method again to learn what should be on the screen.
                This time, this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so the render output will
                include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly.</p>

            <p>If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle
                hook so the timer is stopped.</p>

            <h2>Using State Correctly</h2>
            <p>There are three things you should know about setState().</p>

            <p><em>Do Not Modify State Directly</em></p>
            <p>For example, this will not re-render a component:</p>

            <pre><code>
// Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello';
</code></pre>

            <p>Instead, use setState():</p>

            <pre><code>// Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'}); </code></pre>

            <p>The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor.</p>

            <h2>State Updates May Be Asynchronous</h2>
            <p>React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance.</p>

            <p>Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for
                calculating the next state.</p>

            <p>For example, this code may fail to update the counter:</p>

            <pre><code>// Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
});</code></pre>

            <p>To fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function
                will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied
                as the second argument:</p>

            <pre><code>// Correct
this.setState((prevState, props) =&gt; ({
  counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
}));</code></pre>

            <p>We used an arrow function above, but it also works with regular functions:</p>

            <pre><code>// Correct
this.setState(function(prevState, props) {
  return {
    counter: prevState.counter + props.increment
  };
});</pre></code>

            <h2>State Updates are Merged</h2>
            <p>When you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state.</p>

            <p>For example, your state may contain several independent variables:</p>


            <pre><code>  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  }</pre></code>

            <p>Then you can update them independently with separate setState() calls:</p>

            <pre><code>
  componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts
      });
    });

    fetchComments().then(response =&gt; {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments
      });
    });
  }</code></pre>


            <p>The merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely
                replaces this.state.comments.</p>

            <h2>The Data Flows Down</h2>
            <p>Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they
                shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class.</p>

            <p>This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other
                than the one that owns and sets it.</p>

            <p>A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components:</p>

            <code>&lt;h2&gt;It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;</code>

            <p>This also works for user-defined components:</p>

            <code>&lt;FormattedDate date={this.state.date} /&gt;</code>

            <p>The FormattedDate component would receive the date in its props and wouldn’t know whether it came from
                the Clock’s state, from the Clock’s props, or was typed by hand:</p>

            <pre><code>      
function FormattedDate(props) {
  return &lt;h2&gt;It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.&lt;/h2&gt;;
}</code></pre>

            <p>This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some
                specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them
                in the tree.</p>

            <p>If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component’s state is like an additional
                water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down.</p>

            <p>To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an App component that renders three
                &lt;Clock&gt;s:</p>

            <pre><code>
function App() {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;Clock /&gt;
      &lt;Clock /&gt;
      &lt;Clock /&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  &lt;App /&gt;,
  document.getElementById('root')
);</code></pre>

            <p>Each Clock sets up its own timer and updates independently.</p>

            <p>In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of
                the component that may change over time. You can use stateless components inside stateful components,
                and vice versa.<p>
